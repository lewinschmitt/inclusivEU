**In short**

The European Commission is one of the most central bodies in EU politics, boasting a workforce of over 32,000 civil servants. However, it suffers from a diversity gap when it comes to the representativeness of its staff across many key dimensions. While progress has been made to include more women in middle and senior management and to improve access for people with disabilities, the inclusion of historically underrepresented groups of people remains inadequate.

Our project team of Europaeum scholars has committed to addressing this problem. To do so, we conducted interviews with key stakeholders, carried out additional desk research, and drew up a of proposals based on the identified problems. On this page, we present our findings and ideas and also give some background on the process.

It also explains thoroughly the various policy proposals we suggest for advancing diversity in the European Commission's workforce.
