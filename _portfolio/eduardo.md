Eduardo García Cancela is a PhD candidate at Complutense University (Madrid). His current doctoral research focuses on the most recent changes in the European Union’s foreign policy strategy, their consistency with the promotion of EU’s core democratic norms and values, and their impact in the Eastern neighbourhood. More broadly, Eduardo’s main interests relate to European affairs and international politics, democratisation processes, anti-corruption policies and civil society development.

Before starting his PhD, Eduardo completed a Master of Arts in European Interdisciplinary Studies at the College of Europe in Natolin (Warsaw) and graduated in Journalism and International Relations at Nebrija University (Madrid).

He also worked as an intern in the Embassy of Spain in Washington, D.C, and in the Secretariat of the Eastern Partnership Civil Society Forum in Brussels. Moreover, he is currently engaged with the Spanish Federal Council of the European Movement, being an active member of its youth section.
