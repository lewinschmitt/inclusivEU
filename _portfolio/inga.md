Inga is a PhD candidate in Social Policy at the University of Oxford. In her thesis, she is investigating the earnings returns to Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths (STEM) degrees in the United Kingdom, and how they differ by family background. Through this research, Inga hopes to contribute towards more evidence and transparency in policymaking regarding (STEM) education.

Outside of her PhD, Inga is involved in campaigning for greater access to graduate study. For example, she participates in the running of the Nuffield Undergraduate Scholars Institute, the first programme of its kind at the university.

Before starting her PhD, Inga obtained a BSc in Liberal Arts and Sciences (majoring in Policy Science) at Leiden University College in The Hague, and an MSc in Comparative Social Policy from the University of Oxford, which she was able to pursue thanks to partial funding from the Europaeum.
