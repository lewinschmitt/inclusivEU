Research focus: Study of Healthcare law and Social Security law at national and international level. The challenges to be faced in a more diverse Europe.

Mariana’s doctoral thesis focuses on the right of access to the public health system in Spain and in the European Union. The aim of this thesis is to propose a reform of our national law that takes into account the impact of the migratory flows, emphasizing the situation of refugees and irregular immigrants. In addition, she is a public servant here in Spain, being part of the “Social Security Technicians”, a group of state officials responsible for the recognition of rights at national and international level in the field of Social Security. In this role she connects daily with a multicultural European environment, which, unfortunately, is not adequately dealt by the current legal framework.
Mariana was born in Brazil and her native language is Portuguese.
