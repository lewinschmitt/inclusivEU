Mariana’s doctoral thesis focuses on the right of access to the public health system in Spain and in the European Union. The aim of this thesis is to propose a reform of our national law that takes into account the impact of the migratory flows, emphasizing the situation of refugees and irregular immigrants. In addition, she is a public servant here in Spain, being part of the “Social Security Technicians”, a group of state officials responsible for the recognition of rights at national and international level in the field of Social Security. In this role she connects daily with a multicultural European environment, which, unfortunately, is not adequately dealt by the current legal framework.

Mariana was born in Brazil and her native language is Portuguese.
